# Mathematical-Market-Analysis

* Implemented Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes models in R/C++ (Rcpp) for European and Asian option pricing, achieving 88-94% performance improvement through optimized C++ implementations

+ Validated Monte Carlo convergence against analytical Black-Scholes solutions across 100 to 1M simulations, demonstrating theoretical 1/âˆšn convergence rate with statistical accuracy

- Benchmarked computational performance of R vs C++ for arithmetic/geometric Asian options, documenting consistent 10x speedup and linear scalability across simulation sizes
